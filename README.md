# Breast Cancer Images Classification

### Situation

A leading medical research institution, specialising in cancer diagnosis and treatment, is seeking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection by utilising deep learning techniques. The institution has collected a substantial dataset of breast histology images containing both cancerous (invasive ductal carcinoma, IDC) and non-cancerous samples from reputable sources. The institution is now looking for a skilled machine learning engineer to develop a robust deep learning model that can accurately classify IDC histology images.

### Task

As a machine learning engineer, your primary task is to develop, design, analyse, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) histology images from the provided dataset. To achieve this, you should begin with thoroughly exploring the dataset of 5547 breast histology images, with each image size being 50 x 50 x 3 pixels. This exploration will help you gain insights into the distribution of IDC and non-IDC samples, examine image quality, and preprocess the data as necessary.

### Action

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), which accounts for 80% of all breast cancers, is the most prevalent phenotypic subtype. Pathologists routinely identify IDC by visually examining tissue slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Most evaluations of disease aggression, like tumor grading, focus on the region that only has invasive cancer. The first stage of histopathology characterization of extracted breast tissue involves distinguishing areas corresponding to invasive tumors from non-invasive or healthy tissues. Suspected IDCs are subjected to additional tumor differentiation analysis using the Bloom-Richardson and Nottingham grading systems. It takes a lot of time and effort for a pathologist to accurately identify the areas of malignancy while analysing large swathes of benign tissue to identify invasive breast cancer (Romano & Hernandez, 2019).

Deep learning techniques lessen the workload on humans while increasing the effectiveness of grading (Voon et al., 2022). Deep learning techniques can automatically extract features from data, automatically retrieve information from data, and learn sophisticated abstract representations of data. They are capable of resolving issues with conventional feature extraction and have been successfully used in a variety of fields, including biomedical science and computer vision (Xie et al., 2019).

This case study uses two deep learning algorithms to classify invasive ductal carcinoma (breast cancer) histology images in relation to the powerful feature extraction benefits of deep learning and the difficulties in histopathological image analysis of breast cancer.
