# Breast Cancer Images Classification

### Situation

A leading medical research institution, specialising in cancer diagnosis and treatment, is seeking to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer detection by utilising deep learning techniques. The institution has collected a substantial dataset of breast histology images containing both cancerous (invasive ductal carcinoma, IDC) and non-cancerous samples from reputable sources. The institution is now looking for a skilled machine learning engineer to develop a robust deep learning model that can accurately classify IDC histology images.

### Task

As a machine learning engineer, your primary task is to develop, design, analyse, and evaluate a deep learning model capable of accurately classifying invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) histology images from the provided dataset. To achieve this, you should begin with thoroughly exploring the dataset of 5547 breast histology images, with each image size being 50 x 50 x 3 pixels. This exploration will help you gain insights into the distribution of IDC and non-IDC samples, examine image quality, and preprocess the data as necessary.
